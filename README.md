Fish_R_Us is a fake fish supply website that we built for a Web Apps class project. 
It allows users to browse and shop for fish and fish supplies and it also provides an admin panel to manage the store, users, employees, and inventory.

To run the app, we used MAMP/WAMP. Depending on your local machine configurations, you made need to change the config.php file to your local MAMP/WAMP port number and password.
